This repository hosts the files backing up the data and experimental results described in our paper A Branch-and-Price-and-Cut Algorithm for the Bin Packing Problem with Fragile Objects referenced above. The paper is now under revision. A link to it will be provided as soon as possible.

## Instances

The BPPFI files that describe the instances are found in the `instances` folder. The instances in this folder are classic benchmark instances created by [Clautiaux et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2012.04.010). This benchmark set consists of 675 instances containing 50, 100 and 200 items, which are classified into 5 classes based on how they are created in terms of weights and fragilities.

## Results

The results CSV and OUT files are found inside the `results` folder.
